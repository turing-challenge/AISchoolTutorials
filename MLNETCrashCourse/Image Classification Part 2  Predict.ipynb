However, the internal implementation is very different under the covers. In that mentioned sample, it is using a 'model composition approach' where an initial TensorFlow model (i.e. InceptionV3 or ResNet) is only used to featurize the images and produce the binary information per image to be used by another ML.NET classifier trainer added on top (such as LbfgsMaximumEntropy). Therefore, even when that sample is using a TensorFlow model, you are training only with a ML.NET trainer, you don't retrain a new TensorFlow model but train an ML.NET model. That's why the output of that sample is only an ML.NET model (.zip file).\n",
